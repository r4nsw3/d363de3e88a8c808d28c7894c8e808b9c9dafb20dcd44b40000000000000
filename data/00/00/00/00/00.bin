  |   Dodge, jump, and dash your way through hundreds of terrifying         |
  |   geometric levels. Too tough? Bring your friends.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You are a square - a two-dimensional loner in a one-dimensional       |
  |   world. You're just a square, trying to survive dozens and dozens of   |
  |   increasingly intense challenges. You are simply a square with a       |
  |   mission; become a true hero - a Flat Hero. Run, jump, dash, attack    |
  |   - stylishly navigate and survive over 300 handcrafted levels,         |
  |   destroy the most epic bosses and be the two-dimensional hero (or      |
  |   heroes!) you've always dreamed you could be.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Easy to learn and hard to master; it is easy to pick up and even      |
  |   easier to learn, but don't let that fool you! During your adventure   |
  |   you will face increasingly difficult challenges that will require     |
  |   you to master the game's controls on the journey to becoming a true   |
  |   Hero. And while Flat Heroes comes along with a very minimalistic      |
  |   art style, it's spiced up with stunning effects making it one truly   |
  |   unique eye candy experience.                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Got stuck in the campaign or want to survive longer in the            |
  |   challenge modes? Too intense for you to take on alone? Let your       |
  |   friends join the party; Flat Heroes is the perfect couch co-op        |
  |   experience! Invite a few friends, get some pizza and overcome the     |
